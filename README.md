# MAL-Bot
Most of the features in this bot are yet to be added as it is early in development. The commands list will be updated as I add them.

## COMMANDS
Bot command prefix = mal. <br />
Example: mal.anime Attack on Titan <br />

#### Random
cats = Print a random cat fact. (Made this to learn the very basics of API) <br />
coinflip = Flip a coin <br />

#### Search
anime [title] = Search MAL for anime and display the info <br />
manga [title] = Search MAL for manga and display the info <br />

#### Logistical 
ping = Check bot response time <br />
botinfo (Not yet enabled) = Display information about the bot <br />

#### Extra Info 
This bot is still very new and I am working on adding more stuff to it which will allow you to do more things with MAL and your personal anime/manga lists. I'll update this command screen as I add them. <br />
